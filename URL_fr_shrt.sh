pythonw server.py
# This script is used to run the server.py file using Python.
# It uses the pythonw command to run the script in the background without opening a terminal window.
# The server.py file is expected to be in the same directory as this script.
# The shebang line at the top of the script specifies that it should be run using the bash shell.
# The script does not take any arguments and does not produce any output.
# It is assumed that the server.py file is executable and has the necessary permissions set.
# The script is intended to be used as a shortcut to quickly start the server without having to type the command each time.
